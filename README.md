<h2>Full stack developer</h2>
<h3> Available for collaborations on hands-on projects </h3>

<p>As an energetic Software Engineer, I am driven by a relentless passion for leveraging technology to tackle real-world challenges and drive positive change. Through collaborative efforts and hands-on projects, I continuously seek to harness the potential of technology to make a meaningful impact. Concurrently pursuing a medical degree at OAU, I am deeply impassioned by the transformative potential of technology not only within Nigeria and Africa but on a global scale. With a few years of experience, I have embraced the multifaceted role of a full-stack developer, adept at navigating various layers of software development. My ambition lies in revolutionizing healthcare delivery systems and fostering socio-economic growth through the creation of innovative tech solutions. Currently undertaking an intensive one-year full-stack software engineering course by <a href="https://www.alxafrica.com" title="alx website">ALX AFRICA</a>, which commenced in May 2023 and concludes in July 2024, I am actively expanding my skill set and knowledge base to stay at the forefront of technological advancements. Moreover, I have completed a software engineering course through <a href="https://3mtt.nitda.gov.ng/">3MMT</a>, a program initiated by the Federal government of Nigeria, spanning from November 2023 to March 2024. These educational endeavors have equipped me with a robust foundation in software engineering principles and practices.

My commitment to learning and growth is evidenced by my active involvement in project development. Notably, I spearheaded the creation and concept of <a href="">EduFlash</a>, a web application designed to enhance learning experiences by enabling users to generate flashcards using AI technology. Developed in collaboration with a dedicated team, the project showcases my ability to translate innovative ideas into tangible solutions. All of my projects, including EduFlash, are available for review on my GitHub repository, reflecting my dedication to transparency and continuous improvement. I am enthusiastic about contributing my skills and vision to impactful projects and I am committed to ongoing learning and evolution in the dynamic tech landscape. </p>

My certifications in view include:
- C Programming
- Graphic Programming 
- Unix Programming
- Data Structure and Algorithm
- Reverse Engineering and Security
- Python
- Front-end dev
- Linux/command line
- Infrastructure Design and Management
